# Building Banana

Banana uses [Premake](https://premake.github.io/) as its configuration builder.

You can build Banana for Windows and Linux only.

1. First, download the source code.
2. Then, depending on you OS, run the `GenerateProjects` script (the `.bat` one on Windows or the `.sh` one on Linux). This will either create a Visual Studio solution file or a Makefile depending on you OS.
3. Open the solution (or the whole folder if you don't use Windows). Your game will live in the `GameProject` folder.
4. Congratulations, you are now ready to create the most awesome game ever made!
