# Banana üçå

Banana is a 3D game engine written with C++ and OpenGL.

## Get started

First see the [build instruction page](BUILD.md) to build Banana from source. You need to build Banana from source because there is [no editor](#no-editor).

Then, you should take a look at the [get started page](GET_STARTED.md) and the documentation.

## No editor?

The first thing to know about Banana is that there is no editor like with engine such as Unity, Unreal or Godot. Everything has to be implemented in the code of your game. To help you with this, Banana comes with the spectacular [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) library.

The reason why there is no editor (and probably will never be) is that I didn't want to lose time creating a cute UI for no one to use it (I mean who would use Banana when you can just download Godot).
