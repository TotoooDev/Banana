# Get started with Banana

Banana is a game engine that come with no editor, unlike Unity, Unreal or Godot. Every entity and property needs to be set by hand either in the engine code or in a Lua script.

First, you need to [build Banana from source](BUILD.md). Then, you can open the solution file if you use Windows or your favorite text editor if you use anything else.

From there, the `GameProject` project is where you will create your scenes, entities and components.
